## Part 2 Answers

1) **Line 12** will print 3. This is because it is the value of `i`, since the given array only contains 3 elements (i.e. `[100, 200, 300]`). During the loop, `i` will loop through the size of the array, which is 3.
2) **Line 13** will print 150. This is because the value of `discountedPrice` is printed, which is 150. **Line 13** is outside of the loop, so the final value of `discountedPrice` is printed after all instructions within the loop are done. 
3) **Line 14** will also print 150. This is because the value of `finalPrice` is printed, which happens to be the same value as `discountedPrice`. 
4) The function doesn't return anything. This is because the `discounted` variable is declared empty. Since `discounted` is empty, the loop does not run and thus returns blank.
